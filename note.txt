DTO -- > data transfer object is a class or object that will take the data from controller to service and service
to controller .
Entity class : this is responsible to accept the data from service to persistence layer and persistence layer ot
Service .



Important
----------
1. Api Validation  2. exception handling  3. pagination and sorting

how we do api validation ?
whatedver the data comin from the client request need to be validated before they go to database .
---> Hibernate Bean validator
we can use it in DTO bean/ class properties ( this class is responsible to bind the data from controller and bring to
service for processing whatever the data comes as request will be justified with given Hibernate bean validator
---------------------

1st steps : add the dependency  starter-validation
2nd steps: use the annotation to perform bean property validation / @NotNull , @Email. @Max, @Min , @Pattern
3rd step: if we wnat more logic or other rules then we can also create the custom validator
4th step : Enable the validation @valid annotaion where bean is getting data ( mainly in controller)

-------
@pattern  expression very important

custom bean validator
---------------------
case : if we can not use given in-built validation annotaion , we can use our own validation bean and we should create it , how
to do it...
-----> in this project i have used ImageNameValidate and ImageNameValidator two classes under Validate package please check it

------Exception handler-----
Global excepiton handling
@RestControllerAdvice
package used for the global exception handling
exception: package
class: Globla exceptionHandler and ResourceNoFoundException
and response message is set into ApiResponse class

------how to handle the methodargumenthandle exception with single exception controller
    @ExceptionHandler(MethodArgumentNotValidException.class)

can check in the exception package that handdles globally


--------------Pagination------
Pagination will get from jparepository interface because
 it extends ListCrudRepository and ListPagingAndSortingRepositor and QueryByExampleExecutor

  further
  ListPagingAndSortingRepository<T, ID> extends PagingAndSortingRepository<T, ID>

  PagingAndSortingRepository has the method
   Page<T> findAll(Pageable pageable);
   which takes argument of pageable object


   Page interface extends slice interface and slice interface extends streamable( slice interface has method getContent()


   ----Sorting-----
   here we can sort the page content as per our logic , that means what will be the sorting oreder of the content comming
   into page ( or page size sorting)

   There is "Sort"  class with   "Static Method of(int pageNumber, Pagesie, Sort sort)""
   Sort implements Streamable<org.springframework.data.domain.Sort.Order>, Serializable


   ----how to make customize pagin and sorting resposne like how many page size is there and which page total number of page and which one
   is last of the page content etc----------------
   I am goint to make it as general purpose so can use to every other funcitonality tooo
   ----> here i will make the class under dtos package for it
   public class PageableResponse()
{  }
